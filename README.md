**Contributions**\
Overall, we both collaborated on most aspects of this project, so division of contribution is difficult.  Generally, Cong wrote the code that is being used in our driver program including the union, intersection, and difference methods for both interfaces. Milo wrote the driver class that demonstrated the capabilities of the class methods. Cong also wrote the test programs that we used to test each method locally. Each member made an effort to communitcate through Discord and the be reachable when any questions arose. \
**Additional Features**\
Rudimentary test cases included as methods in ArrayBagTest and LinkedBagTest and are demo-ed in main().  Instead of using test methods, we manually implemented each function with sysout and toString methods to ensure all methods are working as intended.  Will implement genuine test cases for next project.\
