## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

Cong wrote the code that is being used in our driver program including the union, intersection, and difference methods for both interfaces.

Each member made an effort to communitcate through Discord and the be reachable when any questions arose. 
**Additional Features**/n
Cong wrote a toString method in each interface for testing purposes and testing classes to ensure the classes worked properly before implementing them in the driver program.
